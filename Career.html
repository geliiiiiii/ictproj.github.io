         <h6>Fisherman</h6>
         <p> Fishing is a reasonably popular vocation given that they are surrounded by water, but that doesn't 
            imply it is simple. They are in charge of searching out fishing spots, dragging the fish out of 
            the water, correctly storing them so they can be sold, and bringing them back to dry land. In
             search of the best sites and densest concentration of fish, many boats will spend weeks or even 
             months at sea. </p>
